			This is a virtual world, I created using unity. This project consists of
			3D models made from blender as well as scanned objects from the surrounding.
			Similarly, the signs that we can see in the virtual world was created using
			Fusion 360 and Adobe Dimension to make it AR compataible. Using, the particle system from unity
			I was able to create spaceship flying simulation and triger sounds throughout the environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was a group project. 4 memebers including myself created their own quadrant of dome.
			I was the producer and lead-unity developer so I created all the trigers, animation and skybox in this
			space-themed virtual environment.

			<p><img src="images/dogif.gif" alt="Pineapple" style="width:400px;height:300px;margin-left:50px; float:right;">
			This is my quadrant called "WASTELAND". I themed it in a sense that when human civilization starts living up in
			space, after certian decades. The space would also be a wastland as we humans are known to trash the place where we
			live. So, this quadrant represents the life after space colonization have taken place.

		</p>
		<p>
			I intentionally kept some old buildings as well as modern space building side to side to represent the evolution
			of humans race. Also, the giant gate at the entrance is from my university SJSU, which is 3D scanned and remeshed it in
				blender. Similarly, I wanted to incorporate "DOGECOIN" as the meme coin had exploded it price to the moon. So, as the reference
				to Elon Musk supporting dogecoing and the price fluctutaion.
