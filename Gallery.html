      <h1>Sculpture/Drawing</h1>
      <br>
      <p>This was a final project of my sculpture class. It took me a three-class session to complete it. </p>
      <p>I choose God Ganesh as my final project because I always worship and admire God Ganesh. Also, God Ganesh is one of the main Gods in Hindu culture. From the start of my sculpture class, I knew I wanted to make a statue of God Ganesh whose upper body is supported by his hand. But I was unsure of how I would proceed it. Even though the structure was not fully supportive, I wanted to create it as exactly how I had imagined. After firing the sculpture in the Kiln, I was very happy yet surprised to see my sculpture not being broken. This project taught me a lesson that, "If you believe in something just go for it". <br>

      <h1>Photoshop</h1>
      <br>
      <p>This was the second project of Art 74 called "Digital Image Composition"</p>
      <p>I wanted to create a meme as well as a 3D effect image. So, I combined both ideas into one to create this piece. This project helped me to navigate more into 3D pop-up images and its possibilities. It was really fun learning to create a 3d effect and meme using Photoshop.

      <h1>Illustration</h1>
      <br>
      <p>This was a project which I was most interested in because it is the combination of illusion and spiral shape.</p>
      <p>I did this project for myself as I'm interested in a spiral shape. There is something about the shape that captures my imagination. Also, the illusion effect is another factor I like to incorporate into my artwork. Similarly, I like to contrast the color so I chose black and yellow to make it stand out. I have three series of spiral art and this is the first part.
