							<h2>Mock Up </h2>
							<br>
							<p>
								I wanted to mock an app of my favourite shoe company called "DULLA".
								One of the reason is also that Dulla doesn't have any app. It's just a website,
								so I created this mock up to visualize how might their app look like if it were ever
								to be made.

							<h2>Follow the Circle</h2>
							<br>
							<p>

								This is my most recent project which I was working on using p5.js.

								Here the user will have a challenge of following the circle to create an image. Every individual will have different images as the circles are randomly places each time. While the user draw something in the canvas the dark theme
								automaticaly sets up to create sense of illusion.

							<h2>GOD</h2>
							<br>
							<p>
								I choose God Ganesh because I always pray and worship Ganesh.
								I always wanted to make a statue of God Ganesh whose upper body is supported by
								his hand. But I was unsure of how I would proceed it. Even though the structure was not
								fully supportive, I wanted to create it as exactly how I had imagined.
								After firing the sculpture in the Kiln, I was very happy yet surprised
								to see my sculpture not being broken. This project taught me a lesson that,
								"If you believe in something just go for it".

							<h2>Meme</h2>
							<br>
							<p>
								This was the second project of Art 74 called "Digital Image Composition"

								I wanted to create a meme as well as a 3D effect image. So, I combined both ideas into one to create this piece. This project helped me to navigate more into 3D pop-up images and its possibilities. It was really fun learning to create
								a 3d effect and meme using Photoshop.

							This is the avatar of the character from a game called Apex Lengends. This character name is Octane, it half-human and half-machine. So, I put a glitched option if the wrong button is pressed. I made this avatar using p5.js.

							<h2>Tick-Tok</h2>

								I used Adobe Xd to create this stop watch. Then I made a gif file of the video which keeps on going on a loop. I got inspired through my phone when I was trying to time myself while running. Its simple but elegent which I'm proud of.
