        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
          <p> Growing up in Nepal, I have been fascinated by the composition and the concept behind
          the art of wood carving. I was interested in the skills of forming creative patterns to form a unique piece of art. I was so much dedicated to learning this form of art that one day I took a carving knife and started to carve a block of wood with my imagination.  My enthusiasm for art continued and when I was in high school, I was introduced to digital art using photoshop which made me curious about the digital platforms. Then I started learning adobe suits which made it much easier for me to practice my art digitally. My country does have aspects of digital art learning; however, it has just started to flourish. So, the US was my best option to persuade my career in Digital Media.  I came to the US 4 years ago to complete my higher studies. I recently completed my Associates from CSM and completing my bachelors in Digital Media from SJSU.</p>
        <p>
          Inspired by great artists like James Turrell, Bob Beltz, and David April, most of my works reflect the spiral shape and light oriented artworks. Recently, I'm more into illusion and spiral shape as I imagine myself in that realm thinking and getting lost with the shapes. I have found this realm and shape to be part of myself and my space for critical thinking. My skill and knowledge of art are placed in visual art, in hopes of making my audience feel what I feel of illusion and spiral shapes. Besides, video games also have been a big part of my life and I always wanted to be a part of designing a  game especially VR games. So, I want to learn more about VR as well as 3D printing to pace up with the gradual change in technology. After finishing my education from SJSU, I want to work hard and be part of making a virtual gallery to building a 3D printed house on Mars. Art has made me curious, innovative and distinctive and I will always be practicing to create a discrete form of art.
       </p>
        <p>Furthermore, my artwork takes a critical view of shapes and patterns. Often referencing the interactive and connective visual, my work explores the varying relationship between the audience and their connection to my artworks.  Each of my projects often consists of multiple works, often in a range of different media, grouped around specific themes and meanings. My projects have always been grounded in pleasure and aesthetics. I always like to create my art and put it in front for people to get their perspective on what they see. I have received criticism, praise, and feedback which have all favored me to grow myself.
