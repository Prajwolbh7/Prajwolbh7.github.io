						<h2>Mock Up </h2>
						<br>
						<p>
							I wanted to mock an app of my favourite shoe company called "DULLA". I use there website to buy most of my shoes and I wanted to mock it. One of the reason is also that Dulla doesn't have any app. It's just a website, so I created this mock up to visualize how might their app look like if it were ever to be made. I used Adobe Xd to create the animation and illustartion to create the small icons for the app. Then added some components into one to create the gif.

						<h2>Spiral 1</h2>
						<br>
						<p>
						Beginning of this year, I got into spiral shapes as it had different uniqueness to it. So, I created three spiral shapes but in different formations and color. This is the first artwork of my spiral series. It is my circular spiral. The circle and spiral together form this depth illusion. From inner to outer side the spiral changes it's color and size.

						<h2>Spiral 2</h2>
						<br>
						<p>
							I'm interested in the shape of a spiral as it connects me to a different realm. I find the spiral shape very different and unique from others for some reason. This particular piece is my square spiral.

						<h2>Spiral 3</h2>
						<br>
						<p>

							This was a project which I was most interested in because it is the combination of illusion and spiral shape.

							I did this project for myself as I'm interested in a spiral shape. There is something about the shape that captures my imagination. Also, the illusion effect is another factor I like to incorporate into my artwork. Similarly, I like to contrast the color so I chose black and yellow to make it stand out. I have three series of spiral art and this is the first part.

						<h2>GOD</h2>
						<br>
						<p>
							I choose God Ganesh because I always pray and worship Ganesh. I knew that I wanted to make a statue of God Ganesh whose upper body is supported by his hand. But I was unsure of how I would proceed it. Even though the structure was not fully supportive, I wanted to create it as exactly how I had imagined. After firing the sculpture in the Kiln, I was very happy yet surprised to see my sculpture not being broken. This project taught me a lesson that, "If you believe in something just go for it".

						<h2>Shooting in the Dark</h2>

						This is a game made in p5.js. I wanted to make a user interactive and suspensefull game which in order to win, the user have to be focus the movement of the cursor. It's like walking with eyes close, hence the title "Shooting in the Dark".

						<h2>What's inside</h2>
						<br>
						<p>
							This project is about, what a person's soul desires. I used a picture of the actress to make it interesting and using photoshop combined both images. I've seen this trend of double exposer going for while in instagram so I created one for myslef.

						<h2>Meme</h2>
						<br>
						<p>
							This was the second project of Art 74 called "Digital Image Composition"

							I wanted to create a meme as well as a 3D effect image. So, I combined both ideas into one to create this piece. This project helped me to navigate more into 3D pop-up images and its possibilities. It was really fun learning to create a 3d effect and meme using Photoshop.

							This is the avatar of the character from a game called Apex Lengends. This character name is Octane, it half-human and half-machine. So, I put a glitched option if the wrong button is pressed. I made this avatar using p5.js.

						<h2>HyperSpeed</h2>
						<br>
						<p>
							I created this image using Photoshop, I used wave and distorted function to create a glitchy looking horse from a normal horse image. The inspiration came while I watching was cartoon where a spaceship just vanaish in the space. Zooming down frame by frame I saw a lilttle red light and zig-zag image. So, I attempted to create one using always runnig animal- Horse.
