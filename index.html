          <p> 
            Growing up in Nepal, I have been fascinated by the composition and the concept behind the art of carving. I was interested in the skills of forming creative patterns to form a unique piece of art. I was so intrigued by learning this form of art that I used to carve candles into different shapes and figurines. My enthusiasm for art continued and when I was in high school, I was introduced to digital art using photoshop which made me curious about the digital platforms. Then I started learning Adobe Suites which made it much easier for me to practice my art digitally. My country does have aspects of digital art learning; however, it has just started to flourish. So, the U.S. was my best option to peruse my career in Digital Media. Therefore, I came to the United States four years ago to complete my higher education. I recently completed my Associate Degree from College of San Mateo and I’m completing my bachelor’s degree in Digital Media Art from SJSU.

          Inspired by great artists like James Turrell and David Mcleod, I try to use big space and contrast light to create aesthetically pleasing artworks. My artwork takes a critical view of shapes and patterns. Often referencing the interactive and connective visually, my work explores the varying relationship between the audience and their connection to my artworks. Most of my artworks are interactive as they give different results and views depending on the user. It gives me the pleasure of knowing that my artwork is being used to create something meaningful to the viewer.

          Furthermore, video games also have been a big part of my life and I always wanted to be a part of designing a game especially, VR games. So, I want to learn more about VR as well as 3D printing to pace up with the gradual change in technology. After finishing my education at SJSU, I want to work hard and be part of making a virtual gallery to building a 3D printed house on Mars. Art has made me curious, innovative, and distinctive, so I’m confident that my work will always be unique.
